# Simple Blog made with Flask

This is a simple functional blog created with Flask, based on the framework's official documentation with some extra cool features. In this app the user is able to:

- See all existing blog posts;
- Create a new account;
- Login into an existing account;
- Create blog posts;
- Edit blog posts;
- Delete blog posts;
- Like blog posts;

Some new features will be added in the next versions, as:

- User's profile page;
- Edit user's profile ;
- Visit another user's profile page;
- Add, edit or remove comments to posts;

Flask is such an amazing framework, it's simple, fast and functional and I love when I get the chance to use it in real world projects!

You're welcome to clone this repository and run it yourself. If you do that, I would appreciate your feedback!

### Enjoy!
